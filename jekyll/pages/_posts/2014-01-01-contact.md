Looking to get ahold of me? The best place to reach me for anything longer than a tweet is via email at <mark@marktrapp.com>. Otherwise, feel free to message me on Twitter at [@itafroma][1]. I generally respond to email and messages within 24 hours.

**Note for recruiters:** while you are welcome to contact me via email, please do not call me or try to connect with me via LinkedIn. I reserve those forms of communication for people I have a prior working relationship with. Please also note that I am currently happy with my current position and am unlikely to respond to your inquiries at this time.
