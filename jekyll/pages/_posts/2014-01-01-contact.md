Looking to get ahold of me? The best place to reach me for anything longer than a tweet is via email at <mark@marktrapp.com>. Otherwise, feel free to message me on Twitter at [@itafroma][1]. I generally respond to email and messages within 24 hours.

I am currently considering projects for March 2014 and beyond: please check out my [strengths, expertise][2] or [my résumé][3] to see if we might be a good fit.
