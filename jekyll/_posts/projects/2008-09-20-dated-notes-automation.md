This [Automator][1] workflow will create a new text file on the Desktop with the name `notes-YYYY-MM-DD.txt`, where `YYYY`, `MM`, and `DD` are replaced with the current year, month, and day, respectively. It will then open that file in the default text editor. This was inspired by a conversation with [Nic Boman][2].
