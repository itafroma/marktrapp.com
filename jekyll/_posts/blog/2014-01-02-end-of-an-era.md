It’s a new year, so that means things have to change, right? On January 31st, my long-term contract with Bear Brook and Brandopoly will end. After 7 years, I’m officially a free agent, looking for the next opportunity.

Coming to this milestone, I realized I haven’t really talked much about what I’ve done at Bear Brook, at least not directly. At its core, Bear Brook was a client services company: clients came to us with problems, and we figured out ways to solve them. This proved to be a weird situation for me when it came to self-promotion. Unlike a job where you sell a specific product, it felt weird (or many times, inappropriate) to talk about the work we completed. Did the client want the world to know what parts of the job we did? Would people who share my interests really care?

But now that I’m coming to the end of my run with Bear Brook, I feel comfortable talking about the broad strokes. First, I’ll talk a bit about what Bear Brook and Brandopoly were and then I’ll talk about my role there.

## A brief history of Bear Brook and Brandopoly

Bear Brook, a company started by my father in 1984, was in the busines of entertainment and media marketing. If you were an entertainment or media company and needed help with, say, a promotional or marketing campaign, you’d come to Bear Brook and we’d help you with whatever it is you needed help with. Sometimes that meant a new website or marketing collateral, other times it could be coming up with a completely new brand strategy for a new initiative.

In 2002, Bear Brook started work on a product called Brandopoly. The idea behind it was that if you are a large corporation with a set brand strategy, you want to make sure everyone is using it. However, it can be very hard to enforce a branding if your organization is also de-centralized (think a TV network or a corporation split up into multiple offices across the country). What Brandopoly did was provide two things:

1. A complete inventory of every possible marketing or promotional item a company would need for a specific brand
2. A website that was easier and faster to use than Photoshop or InDesign to create branded materials.

The first thing, a complete inventory of all the possible marketing materials, helped ensure that the lack of materials wasn’t a barrier to using a brand. If, say, I’m a salesperson who needs a specific type of one sheet right away, but I don’t have one that’s branded correctly available, I’m either going to use older material or, worse, create one myself. By making sure every possible base was covered, those scenarios could be minimized. And Brandopoly would do it on an on-going basis: if you’re  TV network and you need to get ready for the new fall season, Brandopoly would ensure you had everything you needed.

The second thing, having a system in place that was faster and easier to use than the alternatives, was essential to making sure people used the stuff available. If it’s easier for me to just mock something up in Photoshop than it is to use the branded materials, I’m not going to bother with the branded stuff.

The two aspects of Brandopoly allowed companies to get their branded stuff out in front of everybody really, really fast. Instead of waiting days to get the new branded materials, and hours to modify them for the specific use cases, teams would be able to create customized marketing materials with the correct branding within a few minutes. Brandopoly, in a lot of cases, obviated the need for an on-site design team.

## My role

I actually started working for Bear Brook as a summer job in college in 2004. I was looking for something to do besides working as a customer service rep for a local Stop and Shop (the job I had throughout high school), and I got an opportunity to shadow Bear Brook’s systems support analyst (SSA). It was right about this time that Brandopoly was getting into gear, so I got to spend a lot of time seeing how the sausage was made: technical meetings, getting servers up and running, and so on. But Brandopoly, while interesting, was only a part of what Bear Brook was doing at the time and a lot of my time was spent working on pretty rote technical support issues: software licenses, setting up machines, etc.

It was something of a weird setup: most of the employees were designers or salespeople, but Brandopoly was a highly technical project. Rather than bringing a bunch of people in house, Bear Brook contracted with a few different companies to get Brandopoly up and running with only the SSA and myself as the in-house technical team. By the time the summer was over, the SSA had left and I became the sole technical person on site. When I left, the outside teams took over pretty much all the technical stuff for Bear Brook.

A couple of years later, Bear Brook was big enough that it wanted to have an in-house technical team again, I was asked to help make it work. In 2006, I started working from college remotely part time, then eventually left college to work on-site full time as Bear Brook’s IT manager. I acted as the technical liason for our vendors and our clients, helping to figure out and implement the technical requirements for jobs as they came in.

By 2009, Brandopoly became more or less the main focus of Bear Brook, and I took over the continued development of it: a small-business, self-serve version was developed, then the main enterprise version was rewritten from its 8-year-old codebase on managed, physical servers to a more modular system that could run anywhere.

Developing and maintaining Brandopoly was where I’ve been since.

## What’s next

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says the average time a person stays at a job is now 4.4 years, with most millenials (of which I am a part) expect to stay at any one job for less than 3 years. This January will be my 7th anniversary working for Bear Brook continuously: it’s time for a change.

I’m itching to apply my knowledge to new challenges. I have a few personal projects I’ll no doubt spend some time on over the next few months, but if you, or someone you know, is looking for someone with my background, skills, and expertise, [let’s definitely talk].
