Hello, I’m Mark. I am a programmer, an application developer, and a gamer. I live in Portland, Oregon, where my beard fits right in. I attended the [State University of New York — College at Geneseo][1] (SUNY: Geneseo) where I studied analytical philosophy, the [philosophy of language][2], and [cognitive science][3].

## Technical expertise

I’ve been working with PHP since the release of PHP 4 in 2001, and at a professional level since 2004.

I begun to work with [Drupal][4] starting in 2004, and extensively at a professional level between 2007 and 2012 ([Certified to Rock score][5]: 4). I maintain a contrib module on Drupal.org, [Date Popup Authored][6], as well as a [few forks and one-off modules on GitHub][7].

More recently, I've embraced the modern PHP movement, including [Composer][8], the [PHP-FIG standards][9], and package/library-driven development.

I have a working knowledge and some experience with the following:

* Ruby: scripting and [Jekyll][10] plugin development
* JavaScript: browser extensions and front-end (mainly jQuery)
* Lua: [World of Warcraft][11] AddOn development

I have had training in C, C++, Java, Common Lisp, and Objective-C (Cocoa), but I have not had many reasons to use them in several years. I can read and understand the flow of most other languages.

## Other knowledge

Because of my professional background, I understand and have an appreciation for most of the basic priciples of design and typography.

Due to my educational background, I am formally trained in analytical reasoning, symbolic logic, and argumentation. In addition, I am a [Dale Carnegie training][12] graduate, for which I received the highest award for achievement.

Finally, because of my interests and hobbies, I have an appreciation for game design, including gamification and what makes a game fun to play.

## Past work

I’ve worked for [Bear Brook][13] and its subsidiary, [Brandopoly][14], over the past 10 years. In 2004, I worked as a systems administrator over the summer, helping the company standardize its software license compliance. In 2006, I re-joined Bear Brook as a part-time IT manager and soon left college to work for them full-time.

My responsibilities included the management of the Bear Brook's computers and servers, implementation of security and disaster-recovery protocols, developemnt of web services for clients, and acting as the technical liason for vendors and clients.

In 2008, Bear Brook transitioned all of its employees from working full-time at a physical space to full-time contractors out of virtual office. I designed and implemented the systems that made that transition possible, including file servers, VPNs, and remote computer management.

In 2009, I took over the development of a new initiative to create a version of Brandopoly for small businesses, the first major development on the Brandopoly product in 5 years.

In 2011, I transitioned to the Lead Developer role of Brandopoly and over the next two years architected and oversaw the complete rewrite of its enterprise product, its first rewrite since its initial development in 2003.

Prior to Bear Brook, I had a number of roles at SUNY: Geneseo’s department of computing and information technology:

* Mac technician: acted as technical support for college residents who owned and used Macs
* Residential manager: coordinated the on-site technical support team for one third of the college residents
* HelpDesk manager: co-managed the centralized support team for all college residents
* Staff assistant: assissted the CIT professional staff with their duties

## Interests and hobbies

I’m an avid gamer. While I generally focus on [Japanese/Eastern RPGs][15], [4X strategy games][16], and traditional [roguelikes][17], but I’ll try anything with an interesting premise or mechanic. I’ve been gaming on a Mac since the days of the Macintosh SE/30, and refuse to believe [it’s dead][18]. I’ve also been a console gamer since the 8-bit era (Game Boy → Genesis → PlayStation → PlayStation 2 → PlayStation 3 → Wii U).

While I don’t like flying, I like to travel on the open road when I get the chance. In college, I traveled cross-country over 10 days from New York to California, visiting Chicago, Madison, the Badlands (Wall Drug is overrated), Montana, Washington, and the Oregon coast along the way. Recently, I’ve taken trips out to see all of the Cascades.

Owing to the traveling or a childhood fascination with maps, I also have a deep interest in geography and cartography (Winkel tripel projection][19] for life!).
