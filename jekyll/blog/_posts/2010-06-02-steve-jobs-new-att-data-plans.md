This morning, I checked TechMeme and saw the big news: AT&T decided to restructure its data plans to remove the option for unlimited data. This disappoints me greatly: I, like I'm sure thousands of other customers, bought the iPad WiFi + 3G based on the deal Apple struck with AT&T to offer a no-contract, $30/month, cancel-and-activate any time you need it plan. Like Gizmodo said, the purchase was insurance in case I ever needed to be on 3G exclusively for a while.

The new plans, I believe, are a total bait-and-switch. I don't begrudge AT&T's right to change their prices, but I do find it disappointing that they did it no more than a month after the iPad WiFi + 3G launched, and a couple weeks after the return window ended. So, I decided to write to Steve Jobs in what I thought would be a vain release of my frustration:

> Hi Mr. Jobs,
>
> Under any other circumstance, I would never e-mail you: your time is much more valuable than to answer silly questions about rumor and speculation.
>
> But today's announcement by AT&T, to discontinue their unlimited plan for even the iPad is too insane.
>
> Like hundreds of thousands of your loyal customers, I bought an iPad 3G sight unseen. You've never steered me wrong, and every time you sell a new product, you deliver 110%. When you announced the iPad 3G, you also announced a truly awesome deal with AT&T to provide no-contract, sign up any time you need it, truly unlimited 3G data for $30/month.
>
> I paid the extra $130 and waited an additional month to get the iPad 3G because of that. Now, a little over a month later, that primary motivating factor has been removed and I either have the option to pay $30/month starting today and never cancel that if I want unlimited data any time in the future, or be stuck with a lame 2GB/month plan. If those were my options at the time of sale, I would've reconsidered.
>
> I'm disappointed: not because a service changed its price points; that happens. I'm disappointed because, for the first time in my entire life of buying Apple products, I feel like I got sold a bill of goods. It's like buying a car because of its warranty and being notified a few weeks after the return date that the warranty's changed unilaterally.
>
> You've always seemed like a reasonable man; I'm sure you personally didn't know about this switch, and feel just as annoyed as many of your customers feel today.
>
> But it'd go a long way to maintaining trust in Apple to extend the return window for the iPad 3G so customers can make an informed choice about which model is right for them.
>
> Thanks and all the best,
>
> Mark Trapp

Much to my surprise, 15 minutes later, I received an e-mail back from Jobs himself:

> I think its going to work out just fine for almost all customers. Try it.

He didn't really address my concern, but it's still pretty cool to get an e-mail from a guy I still respect.

## Update

On October 30th, 2013 I received an email about a [settlement for this very issue][2]. As part of the settlement, anyone who activated their 3G data plan prior to the discontinuation of unlimited data plans is entitled to a $40 cash payment.
