2013 was a great year for games.

Before I get into the list, I There are a few disclaimers and caveats

* These are games that I personally enjoyed playing in 2013


## Civilization V: Brave New World

I was introduced to the Civilization series relatively late: a friend of mine brought the original Civilization at a LAN party back when I was in middle school. I thought it was great and almost immediately went out and bought Civilization II, its expansion pack, "Test of Time", Civilization: Call to Power, and Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri. I didn’t have much fun with vanilla Civ 2, but I had a great time with the fantasy campaigns in *Test of Time*. I absolutely loved teching up in Call to Power and Alpha Centauri (who didn’t?), but I didn’t really pay much attention to a lot of the mechanics of Civilization and mostly treated it as SimCivilization: over building cities, teching into unnecessary things, and trying to build all the wonders merely just to have them.

That changed with *Civilization III*: Civ 3 introduced a new mechanic, culture, which allowed you to expand the borders of your civilization by doing the silly stuff I was doing in earlier games: building *everything*. It even allowed you to conquer your opponents’ cities without raising an army: just out-culture them and the city will defect (so-called "culture flipping"). I know a lot of people find Civ 3 to be the weakest of the series, but I played the *hell* out of it.

Over time I started to appreciate the other mechanics in the Civilization series, and when *Civilization IV* and *Civilization V* came out, I had a good time with them, but I didn’t have as much fun as I did with Civ 3. Civ 4 introduced a number of new systems, the largest being religion, that made culture flipping unviable, or at least unattractive when compared to using missionaries to convert your enemy cities. Civ 5 flat out removed culture flipping altogether.

## Rogue Legacy

* Strong callback to SotN
* Controls are excellent

## Tales of Maj'Eyal

* Traditional roguelike: Rogue -> Angband -> Pern Angband -> Tales of Middle Earth -> ToME
* Depth of Mechanics


Unlike *Rogue Legacy* and *Desktop Dungeons*, *Tales of Maj'Eyal* is a true roguelike.

## Persona 4 Golden

* Fusion system is great
* Music and art style unique

## Evoland



## Desktop Dungeons

* Preparation mechanism: takes some randomness out of traditional roguelikes
* One-more-dungeon addictiveness

I first got into *Desktop Dungeons* when it was a simple prototype back in 2010. 


Like *Rogue Legacy*, *Desktop Dungeons* is often billed as a "rogue-lite", but it shares very few features of a roguelike. ILike *Rogue Legacy*, there’s localized permadeath, but a persistance mechanism 

## Thomas Was Alone

Available on
:   Mac, PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita

* Narration is awesome
* Controls are tight
* Claire?

## Endless Space

* Space-based 4X
* Simplified combat
* Clean visuals

## Kingdom Rush Frontiers

* Upgrade mechanics

*Kingdom Rush Frontiers* is a tower defense game [that’s a spinoff/sequel][1] to the 2011 *Kingdom Rush*, which I also enjoyed and played a ton of. It has a great aesthetic with possibly the best art direction I’ve seen in a Flash or iOS game ever, and its control scheme is perfectly suited for touch. It also has a great, many times subtle, sense of humor: if you keep an eye out for them, there are pop/sub-culture references everywhere ranging from certain enemies using the Wilhelm scream to subtle nods to the voice acting in WarCraft II to even the [alien language in *Futurama*][2].

## Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten

Gone Home
The Last of Us
